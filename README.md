# MediaLink IRC Bot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/icedream/irc-medialink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/icedream/irc-medialink)

This IRC bot automatically parses links posted in chat rooms and prints information about them.

Currently explicit support has been built in for:

- YouTube
- SoundCloud
- Twitter
- Wikipedia
- Direct image links

Generally, for websites that are not directly supported the bot will print the page title.

## How to run the bot

In order to properly run the bot, you need to [register a SoundCloud application](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new) and [get a YouTube Data API key](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube/overview) for it and then feed the API data to the bot through the command line arguments.

The bot can be installed through Go using this command:

	go install github.com/icedream/irc-medialink/cmd/medialink

Then you can find out which options you can pass to the bot directly by running (assuming you put your `$GOPATH/bin` folder into your `PATH`):

	irc-medialink --help

You need to at least pass the `--server`, `--youtube-key`, `--soundcloud-id` and `--soundcloud-secret` parameters.

### ...with Docker

You can use the `icedream/irc-medialink` image in order to run this bot in Docker. You can pull it using this command:

	docker pull icedream/irc-medialink

An example with docker-compose would look like this:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mybot:
    image: icedream/irc-medialink
    command:
      - go-wrapper
      - run
      - --youtube-key=<insert your youtube key here>
      - --soundcloud-id=<insert your soundcloud id here>
      - --soundcloud-secret=<insert your soundcloud secret here>
      - --twitter-id=<insert your soundcloud id here>
      - --twitter-secret=<insert your soundcloud secret here>
      - --server=<irc server host>:<irc server port>
      - --nickserv-pw=<nickserv password>
      - --nick=MyBot
      - --ident=botty
      - --password=<server password>
      - --channels=#channel1,#channel2,...
    restart: always
```
